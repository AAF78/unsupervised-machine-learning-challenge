# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

#The myopia.ipynb file is the complete and final version of this homework. It contains all the markdowns necessary to explain my logic. There are 4 main parts to this file: Dependencies; Part I, Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing; Part II: PCA- Dimensionality Reduction, and Part III: K-Means Model. There is a brief recommendation following the scatterplot. 

Datasets used/created with this file include "myopia.csv" (original source data) and "myopia_cleaned_3.csv" (the cleaned and processed data to input into the models).
